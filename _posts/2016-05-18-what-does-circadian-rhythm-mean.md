> 
> > [Circadian rhythms][0] are physical, mental and behavioral changes that follow a roughly 24-hour cycle, responding primarily to light and darkness in an organism's environment. They are found in most living things, including animals, plants and many tiny microbes.
> 
> > A [circadian rhythm][1] is any biological process that displays an endogenous, entrainable oscillation of about 24 hours. These 24-hour rhythmsare driven by a circadianclock, and they have been widely observed in plants, animals, fungi, and cyanobacteria
