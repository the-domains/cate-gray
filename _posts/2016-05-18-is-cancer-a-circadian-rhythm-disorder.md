I have a question. "Is cancer is primarily a circadian rhythm disorder?" 

There is an increased cancer rate of people who work night shifts, especially rotating night shifts, and a reduced incidence of cancer in societies that don't use electricity as well as amongst totally blind people. 

I'm going to find experts and ask them what they think.
